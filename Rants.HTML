            <p> I have been listening to the DELTARUNE soundtrack for a week now, its so good and its so cool to hear all the leitmotifs. Basically every song is a fusion of like a bunch of leitmotifs. Its cool on a surface level but its so useful at helping tell stories and themes with the music. Just the Freedom Motif alone creates so much cool themes just by existing in a song. It also just is really cool to see characters get entire soundtracks around them just based on there leitmotif. Mr.Tenna's leitmotif alone made him a top pick for me, never understood what people meant by comfort character really meant until then. I have a photo of him on my desk now.</p>
